We used to waste precious hours comparing gift prices across markets. Then, during a team call, Swift Gifts was born.  
🎁 Now our algorithm hunts down the most Hot Deals across any marketplace — even hidden in off-chain Telegram MiniApps.  
TON blockchain-powered smart-contract routing for instant swaps. Just pick a collection + filters → the system finds the best price for you → choose one → simply buy it via smart-contract.  
It’s just like having a personal gift consultant right in your pocket.
